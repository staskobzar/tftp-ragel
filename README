### tftp client

TFTP command line client for getting and putting files to tftp server.
This project is not trying to replace existing tftp clients.
I started it just to learn how to write robust protocol implementation using ragel state machine.

Client is written with C with Apache Portable Runtime. Using cmocka for unit tests and DejaGNU for behaviour testing.

tftpclient [OPTIONS] server filename

      Put file to remote tftp server.

      Print additional infomation during transfer.
